# Fake-Job-Listing

###PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project aims to create distinctions that will have the potential to identify fake and real jobs. The final result is analyzed based on two different models. Since the data provided has numerical and textual features, one model will be used for text data and the other for numerical data. The end result will be a combination of the two. The final model will capture any relevant job data and generate final results that determine whether the task is real or not.

###DATASET

This project uses information provided by Kaggle. This data contains features that define job posting. These postings are classified as true or false. Fraudulent deployment is a small fraction of this database.
